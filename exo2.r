#we know that gamm(3/2) = sqrt(pi) / 2
#by making a IPP we see that Int(g) = 1/2 * Int(exp{-x^2} dx)
#by making the change of variable x =sqrt(2)*x and using the density of the normal law
#we find that gamma(3/2) = Int(g)
#and g(-Inf) = g(Inf) = 0 therefore g is a density

#f/g(x) = (3 + sin(x)^2)/(1 + cos(x)^2)^2 * 1/gamma(3/2)
#f/g < 4/gamma(3/2)
